Throughout the project setup for the "code-challenge" data engineering task, I encountered several key challenges and achieved multiple milestones. The project's goal was to construct an ETL pipeline that extracts data from two sources: a PostgreSQL database and a CSV file, to then load the data onto a local disk before finally uploading it to a PostgreSQL database. The tools chosen for the task were Airflow for orchestration, Embulk for data transfer, and PostgreSQL as the database. Below, I detail my journey, the challenges I faced, and the solutions I implemented.

**Initial Setup and Configuration**

I began by setting up Docker and Docker Compose on my Windows system, ensuring that all services, including Airflow, PostgreSQL, and Embulk, were correctly configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file. This step was straightforward, thanks to my prior experience with Docker environments.

**Airflow Integration**

Integrating Airflow was among the initial tasks. After setting up the Docker containers, I accessed Airflow via `localhost:8080` and configured the necessary connections to PostgreSQL. The setup was intuitive, and configuring the connection `postgres_northwind` went smoothly.

**Challenge 1: Activating Embulk**

A significant hurdle was activating Embulk within the Docker environment. Despite correctly placing Embulk in the `docker-compose.yml`, it failed to become active. This issue was critical since Embulk was essential for data extraction and transformation. After several attempts and reviewing Embulk's documentation, I realized the problem might not be solvable within the current setup constraints. I decided to explore alternative tools but faced a similar issue with Meltano, which also did not activate as expected.

**Solution to Challenge 1**

Given the persisting issues with Embulk and then Meltano, I decided to take a step back and reassess my approach. I focused on understanding the underlying issue by consulting online forums and Docker documentation. Realizing that the issue might be related to Docker's networking and volume mounting on Windows, I experimented with different configurations. However, time constraints made it impractical to resolve this fully within the project timeline.

**Adaptation and Progress**

Understanding that the primary objective was to showcase my ability to handle data engineering tasks, I pivoted my approach to focus on what could be achieved. I deepened my understanding of Airflow by setting up DAGs that could theoretically execute the required tasks, ensuring each step was idempotent and well-documented within the code.

**Learning Outcomes and Conclusion**

This project underscored the importance of adaptability and problem-solving in data engineering. While not all objectives were met, primarily due to technical challenges with Embulk within a Docker environment, I gained valuable insights into workflow orchestration with Airflow, Docker container management, and the intricacies of setting up a robust ETL pipeline. The experience has prepared me to tackle similar challenges in the future with a stronger foundation and a strategic approach to problem-solving.

In conclusion, the "code-challenge" project was a significant learning curve. It reinforced the necessity of flexibility in technology choices and the importance of rigorous documentation and problem-solving strategies in data engineering. Moving forward, I am confident in my ability to navigate similar challenges and contribute effectively to data engineering projects.
